											<li><b>Sound Exposure Level</b> is the logarithmic measure of the Sound Pressure Level squared and integrated over a stated period of time or event, relative to a reference sound pressure value. The SEL is reported using the unit of the Decibel, abbreviated dB.</li>

											<li> The <b>A-weighted Sound Level</b> (dB A) is a measure of sound pressure level designed to reflect the acuity of the human ear, which does not respond equally to all frequencies.</li>

											<li>The <b>Ambient Noise Level</b> is the lowest measured sound level at a given location and time without the noise source of interest operating.</li>
