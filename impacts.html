								<p>Chronic exposure to elevated levels of community noise creates significant health risks.  These health impacts of noise depend on the intensity of noise, on the duration of exposure, and the context of exposure.</p>

								<p>Noise annoyance is defined as “a feeling of resentment, displeasure, discomfort, dissatisfaction, or offense when noise interferes with someone's thoughts, feelings, or actual activities”</p>

								<p>Moderate levels of noise can limit or interfere with the ability to conduct daily tasks and activity — to have an ordinary conversation, enjoy a leisure activities, rest, sleep, concentrate or get tasks done.</p>

								<p>Noise from moderate levels of road traffic impairs cognitive functioning in children, including attention, concentration, sound discrimination, memory, and reading ability.  Some children exposed to moderate levels of road traffic noise develop deficits in reading ability and suffer lower school in school performance.</p>

								<p>Noise interferes with sleep. Noise can make it difficult to fall asleep, and abrupt noises can cause awakenings, which the sleeper may not sense or recall.  Even at levels below which awakening may occur, noise produces measurable physiological reactions, such as increase in heart rate and body movements and can cause disturbances of natural sleep patterns by causing shifts from deep to lighter stages. People affected by noise may get up "tired" or "not rested" in the morning.</p> 
								
								<p>Noise is a biological stressor; it triggers autonomic chemical mechanisms for arousal and alertness. Consequentially, noise may cause or aggravate conditions related to chronic stress.</p>

								<p>While evidence is not yet conclusive, exposure to higher levels road traffic noise is associated with higher a risk for myocardial infarction and exposure air traffic noise is  associated with hypertension.</p>
