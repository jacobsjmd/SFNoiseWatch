								<h2>Noise Sources</h2>
								<p>Cities have many sources of noise; many of the more significant and preventable sources arise from traffic and industry. Motor vehicle traffic is usually the single greatest contributor of noise in most cities.</p>

								<h4>Traffic</h4>

								<p>Motor vehicle noise, including noise from automobiles, motorcycles, buses, and trains, is a result of  (1) vehicle traction systems including the engine, braking, exhaust (2) the interface of the wheel and the road or rail and (3) displacement of air, which is important at high speeds.</p>

								<p>While modern vehicle are designed to limit noise, some people make illegal modifications to exhaust systems, which are designed to create obnoxious noise.</p>

								<p>Traffic noise disproportionately affects residents living near highways and freight and transit routes A heavy truck will produce approximately twenty to thirty times more sound energy than a personal automobile.</p>

								<p>Emergency response vehicles are problematic sources of noise for residents living near hospitals or police and fire stations. 
								
								<p>Public sanitation vehicles make loud noises when picking up or compacting refuse.</p>

								<p>Alarms and back-up beepers are relatively new but highly obnoxious forms of traffic noise and are largely unregulated.</p>

								<p>Traffic noise is not inevitable; cities can minimize traffic noise by maintaining roads, constructing sound barriers, reducing vehicle speeds, enforcing illegal vehicle modifications, carefully routing freight trucks, choosing electric buses, and increasing the use of public transit, bicycles, and walking.</p>

								<h4>Industry</h4>

								<p>Many noise complaints result from proximity of housing to businesses, industries, and institutional uses.</p>

								<p>Residential-industrial noise conflicts arise from mechanical equipment, loading and unloading of delivery vehicles, heavy truck backup beepers, generators, and refrigeration equipment.</p>

								<p>Mechanical ventilation systems, particularly those on rooftops can be a significant annoyance if there is an adjacent residential building that is higher.</p>

								<p>Modern construction involves diesel powered heavy equipment, loud electric and pneumatics tools and frequent freight delivery.</p>

								<p>Powered equipment, like gas powered leaf blowers used for property maintenance is a common source of noise annoyance.</p>

								<p>Thoughtful planning and building rules and their strict enforcement can mitigate many noise conflicts.  Zoning codes can limit the incompatible proximal location of residential and commercial uses.  Building code can require acoustical insulation to keep sound inside bars and clubs and to keep living and sleeping areas quite while adequately ventilated.</p>
